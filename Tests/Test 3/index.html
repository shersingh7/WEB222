<!--I have mostly used sections and div for much easier webpage management. I have used the unordered listings for the hyperlinks.
I have also used forms for contact us input and has sused the required attribute for the forms which were required for sunmission.
I have also used img alt attribute for the helping the people with disabilities to easily know the webpage.
I have used the button tag for the submit button.  -->
